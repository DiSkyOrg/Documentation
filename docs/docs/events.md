# Events

[[[% import 'macros.html' as macros %]]]

## Information: Retrieve-Values

For some event, you can see a `retrieve values` section. Some values are given by Discord directly, and others needs another **request** to Discord to get the value (those are in as `retrieve values`).

!!! example ""
    For instance in the [Reaction Add Event](#on-reaction-add), Discord gives us the message ID only, so you can use its retrieve value to get the actual message:

    ```applescript
    on reaction add:
        # </>

        retrieve event value "message" and store it in {_message}
        # now you can use {_message} as the message that was reacted to!
    ```
