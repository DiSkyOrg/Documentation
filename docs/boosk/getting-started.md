## Requirements

- Spigot/Paper `1.16.X` or higher

!!! warning "We do not support CraftBukkit or any other fork that are not based on paper/spigot!"

??? danger "Information related to Skript's manipulation"
    BooSK will change Skript's code using reflection, more specifically the `open book` effect (for obvious reasons).

    Although BooSK should also implements the default Skript behavior, it's not guaranteed to work for any case, and feel free to reports that to the developer as soon as you've discovered something similar!
