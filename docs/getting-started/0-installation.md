# Installation

You'll see here how to **install** DiSky correctly.

## 1. Server Requirements

DiSky is pretty flexible on server requirements, however some needed points must be completed:

* While **Skript** work, DiSky will work.
* DiSky **require** Skript v**2.10+**!
* ... and that's all!...

While Skript is running good, and using 2.10+ version, DiSky should run without any problem!

We however recommend [**the official fork**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/latest) of Skript (maintained by _SkriptLang_).

!!! warning "Since v4.21.0, DiSky now requires Skript 2.10 or higher!"
    If you are using an older version of Skript, you will need to update it to use DiSky, or use an older version of DiSky, which, of course, won't have the latest features nor support.

## 2. Installation

Once Skript & DiSky are downloaded, move them in the `plugins/` folder and **restart** your server.

!!! warning
    **Reloading** your server is the worst thing to do! No support will be provided if you do so.

Wait a little for Skript & DiSky to load, then go into `plugins/Skript/scripts/`, create a new file ending by `.sk` and write your first script!

## Add-ons Compatibility

DiSky is a pretty big add-on, that's add a lot of different features.

Some **syntax** can be in conflicts with others from Add-ons.

!!! info
    DiSky try to avoid any conflict **with Skript**, but cannot always think about every other add-ons!

## Configuration

DiSky **don't need** to be configurable, everything is done through Skript code.

You can still request configuration keys for X or Y features on our **Discord** or in the [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky)
